This is a project assigned via the Odin Project to learn web development
fundamentals. Using basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with an emphasis on
DOM manipulation, the goal of this project is to create a dynamically sized
grid of squares that change color when moused over in order to emulate drawing
on an Etch-a-Sketch.
